OCTOBER-26,WEDNESDAY

CLOUD:
* The term cloud is refer to a Network internet
* cloud is present in a remote location
* It can provide services over public and private network.
* WAN,LAN,VPN


CLOUD COMPUTING:

* it will refers to manipulating,configuring and accessing the  hardware and software resources remotely
* Cloud will offer online data storage, infrastructure and applications.
* servers, databases, computing resources, storage, software
* cloud computing is platform independent (means it will run on all the platform)
* it is the use of remote servers on a internet to store, to manage and to process data rather than a local server or a personal computer.

before cloud computing:
* to host a website these are the following things that you would need to do
  (i)   buy a stack of servers
  (ii)  monitoring and maintain the servers(team)
  (iii) high traffic>>more servers

disadvantages :
* if you consider cost then this setup is expensive
* troubleshooting problems can be be tedious and may conflict with your business goals
* Since the traffic is varying , your servers will be idle most of the time.

why cloud?
* in one day we are generating many terabytes of data
* in our local system we have limited storage
* running out of harddrive space
* easily can move files

what is cloud?
* just moving you data to cloud
* cloud has a unlimited space.

operations using cloud computing:
* using cloud computing develop applications and services
* to store , backup and we can recover the data
* to hosting a website
* delivery of software on demand
* data analaysis 
* streaming videos and audios eg:youtube,netflix,amazonprime,gaana,instagram,FB

characteristics of cloud computing:
* agility(uploading and downloading speed)
* multisharing(for eg: one aws account it can be used by multiple users which is called multisharing)
* high availability and reliability
* device and location independent 
* maintenance is not required
* low cost
* services is meter technology(how much we are using that much only we need to pay)

advantages of cloud computing:
* backup and restore the data
* improved collaboration
* excellent accessbility
* mobility
* unlimited storage capacity
* data security
* pay as you use system

disadvantages of cloud computing:
* limited control (everything is handled by cloud server provider)
* vendor lockin ( all data stored in vendor )

history of cloud computing:
* 1999>salesforce.com started cloud services
* 2002>amazon - it become commercial in 2006
* 2009>google i.e GCP(google cloud platform)
* 2009>microsoft launched Azure

what is cloud computing?
* storing data/applications on remote servers
* processing data/ applications from servers
* accessing data/ applications via internet
* access data anywhere 

how cloud computing happens?
* put your data on cloud servers and voila no more buying expensive servers
* scalability (serves capacity will vary according to traffic, how cool is that)
* cloud provider will manage your servers , hence no worries about the underlying infrastructure

working cloud models:
* deployment model
* service model

deployment model:
*  define the type of access to the cloud i.e (how the cloud is located)
* three types
  (i)    public cloud
  (ii)   private cloud
  (iii)  hybrid cloud

service model:
* manages which type of services  according to client requirement
* three types
  (i)    Iaas
  (ii)   Paas
  (iii)  Saas

public cloud:
* a service provider makes resources such as applications and storage, available to the general public over the internet.
* easy and inexpensive set-up because hardware, application and bandwidth costs are covered by the provider.
* no wasted resources because you pay for what you use.
* The public cloud allows system and services to be easily accessible to the General public 
* less secure because of its openess
* eg:gmail,googledrive,youtube,netflix,aws,azure,gcp

private cloud:
* offers hosted services to a limited number of people behind firewall, so it minimizes the security concerns.
* private cloud gives companies direct control over their data.
* The private cloud allows system and services to be accessible within an organization
* its more secured because of its private nature
* eg: IBM cloud, Oracle cloud,ola,uber, aws,azure,gcp

hybrid cloud:
* a cloud computing environment which uses a mix of on-premises,private cloud and thir-party,public cloud services.
* it helps you leverage the best of both worlds
* hybrid clous is a combination of both public and private cloud 
* The critical activities are performed using private cloud
* the non critical activities are performed using public cloud
* eg: iclouds

Iaas(Infrastructure as a service)
* It provide virtualizeed computing resources over the internet.
* no worries about the underlying physical machine
* abstract the user from the physical machine
* It is also responsible for managing application data
* eg: EC2( Elastic compute cloud), VM(virtual machine), Database,storages,VPC(virtual private cloud)

Paas(Platform as a service)
* no control over the underlying architecture including OS, storage,servers etc.
* the cloud provider gives the ability to the customer to deploy customer created apps using programming languages,tools,etc that are provided by the cloud provider.
* It provide platform for software creation
* It provide runtime environment for application,development and development tools
* eg: deveOps(development of operations), github, colab(used to write a python code and it is owned by google),jnkin,kubernetes,docket

Saas(Software as a service)
*cloud provider leases applications or software which are owned by them to its client.
* It is called as cloud application service
* web browser is required
* softwares are owned by vendor(service provider)
* eg:gmail,outlook,GDrive,CRM,ERP,Zoom,Teams,Youtube,Chrome
* eg:salesforce.com provide the CRM(Customer relation manager) on a cloud infrastructure to its client and charges them for it,but the software is owned by the salesforce company only.

iaas:

       you manage                                   managed by vendor

paas:
data-applications-|runtime-middleware-o/s-virtualization-servers-storage-networking
     you manage                         managed by vendor

saas:
data-|applications-runtime-middleware-o/s-virtualization-servers-storage-networking
you                        managed by vendor
manage

an organization with cloud computing:
on premises-user -> service provider-cloud applications(saas)(computer/storage/network)
|private cloud

Evaluating Saas: users
benefits                                                 risks
* fasterdevelopment                                      * requires trusting s saas provider
  because no local installation is required                for availability and security
* usage-based pricing                                    * can raise legal/regulatory concerns
  letting you pay only for what you use                    with storing data outside customer premises
* less financial risk                                    * can limit customization
  with lower up-front cost and free trials                 if customers share a multi-tenant application
* Reduced need for on-premises resources                 * can be harder to integrate
  such as servers and IT staff                             with on-premises applications 
* Easier upgrades                                        * can have harder to integrate
  with no on-premises software to update                   than on-premises applications


Evaluating Saas: software vendors  eg:google,aws,azure
benefits                                                 risks
* can provide more predictable revenue stream            * must demonstrate real value up front
  than traditional licensing                               due to try-before-you-buy options
* can sell directly to business decision makers          * revenue comes in more slowly
  without going through IT                                 because of typical saas pricing models
* can lower support costs                                * may lessen ability to sell customization
  due to shared multi-tenant application                   services due to multi-tenants applications
* provides more knowledge                                * can bring new sales challenges
  about how customers use the applications                 e.g: customers resistance to the cloud
* offers potential to reach new customers                * requires significant business changes
  in broader markets                                       e.g: pricing and sales.

The impact of Saas:
for users                                                for software vendors
* life is better                                         * life is different
* as long as the risks aren't  showstoppers              * everything changes:pricing,sales,process,operations

Virtualization:
* It is form of creating a virtual(rather than actual) version of something , including computer hardware platforms, storage devices and computer network resources.
* It is replica of real
* it is the process of creating a software-based of virtual representation of something, such as virtual applications,servers,storage,and networks.
* example: virtual desktop, softcopy, , scancopy, zoom meeting, VM(Virtual machine)

physical server/pc  -> virtual server software based
                  hyperviser
                 virtualization

Problems:
* low utilization of resources
* a lot of space needed to host servers
* not flexible
* a lot of maintenance

Types of virtualization:
(i)   hardware virtualization
(ii)  operating system virtualization
(iii) Server virtualization
(iv)  Storage virtualization

(i)   Hardware virtualization
      * when virtual machine software or virtual machine maanger(VMM) is directly installed on hardware system is called as Hardware virtualization
      * After virtualization of hardware system we can install different OS on it and run differnt application on those OS

(ii)  Operating system virtualization:
      * When virtual machine software or virtual machine manager(VMM) is installed on the host operating system instead of directly on the hardware system is called as Operating system virtualization.

(iii) Server virtualization:
      * when virtual machine software or virtual machine manager(VMM) is directly installed on server system is called as Server virtualization.

(iv)  Storage virtualization:
      * Storage virtualization is the process of grouping the physical storage from multiple network storage devices so that it loooks like a single storage device.

NOVEMBER 2 TUESDAY

File handling in python:
* python has s several functions for creating,reading, updating and deleting files
* open()
* "r">read a file
* "w">writing
* "a">append





Devops:
* the DevOps is a combination of two words, one is development and second is operation

     -------------------------------------------------------
         -------------------           ----------------
           developer and                IT operation 
            tester                 
         -------------------           ----------------
                        DevOps
    ------------------------------------------------------------

* with help of DevOps we reduce the disconnection between developer, QA(Quality assurance) and system administrator
* it will promote collaboration between development and operation team to deploy code to production faster in an automated and repeated way



Why DevOps:
* the opreation and development team worked in complete isolation
* without use of DevOps, the team members are spending a large amount of time designing , testing and deploying instead of building a project
* manual code deployment leads to human errors in production

DevOps tools:                                        What's in it for you?
